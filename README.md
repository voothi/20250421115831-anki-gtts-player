# gTTS Player with Piper Fallback for Anki

An enhanced Anki add-on that provides Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionality with a seamless offline fallback, ensuring your study flow is never interrupted.

This add-on modifies the standard gTTS player to be more resilient and versatile. It uses Google's Text-to-Speech service when online but automatically switches to a local, high-quality Piper TTS engine when an internet connection is unavailable or slow.

This project is part of the **[Kardenwort](https://github.com/kardenwort)** environment, designed to create a focused and efficient learning ecosystem.

## Project Philosophy

The primary goal of this enhancement is to create a self-sufficient study environment. Whether you are on the go with limited mobile data or wish to disconnect completely for a focused study session, this add-on ensures your audio cards work flawlessly. By leveraging a local TTS engine, it saves bandwidth, works entirely offline, and removes dependency on an active internet connection.

## Features

-   **Online & Offline Modes**: Utilizes Google's high-quality gTTS service online and seamlessly falls back to a local Piper TTS engine offline.
-   **Automatic Fallback**: If gTTS fails or times out, Piper is used automatically. No broken audio, no interruptions.
-   **On-the-Fly Engine Switching**: Instantly switch between `gTTS` and `Piper` as the primary engine from the `Tools` menu in Anki **without restarting**.
-   **Configurable Timeout**: Prevents Anki from freezing by setting a custom timeout for web requests.
-   **No Template Changes Required**: Works out-of-the-box with your existing card templates that use the standard `{{tts...}}` syntax.

## How It Works

The add-on intercepts Anki's default TTS requests and uses one of two modes:

1.  **gTTS Mode (Default)**: It first attempts to generate audio via the gTTS API.
    -   If the request exceeds the configured timeout or fails due to a network error, it automatically calls the local Piper TTS script as a fallback.
    -   Successfully fetched gTTS files are cached permanently as `.mp3` for future use.

2.  **Piper Mode**: It directly calls the `piper-tts.py` script to generate audio locally. This mode is ideal for fully offline use. Audio generated by Piper is not cached, ensuring it is generated live on each playback request.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Anki**: The Anki desktop application must be running.
2.  **Python 3**: A separate Python 3 installation is required to run the Piper TTS script.
3.  **Piper TTS Utility**: You must have the [Piper TTS Command-Line Utility](https://github.com/voothi/20241206010110-piper-tts) project downloaded and configured.

## Installation

1.  **Install the Add-on**:
    -   Clone this repository into your Anki `addons21` folder.
    -   The folder name **must be** `391644525`.

2.  **Set up Piper TTS**:
    -   Follow the installation instructions in the [Piper TTS Utility repository](https://github.com/voothi/20241206010110-piper-tts).

3.  **Configure the Add-on**:
    -   Open the add-on folder (`addons21/391644525`).
    -   Create a file named `config.json` using the template below.
    -   **You must update the paths** in `config.json` to point to your Python executable and `piper_tts.py` script.

4.  **Restart Anki**.

## Configuration

Create a `config.json` file in the add-on's directory (`391644525`) with the following content.

```json
{
    "tts_engine": "gTTS",
    "gtts_timeout_sec": 5,
    "piper_python_path": "C:/Python/Python312/python.exe",
    "piper_script_path": "U:/voothi/20241206010110-piper-tts/piper_tts.py"
}
```
